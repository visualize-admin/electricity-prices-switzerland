## Session Configuration for SPARQL Endpoint

Through the [session-config](./session-config.md) feature, users can change the SPARQL endpoint for their
current session.

To configure a custom SPARQL endpoint:

1. Login to `/api/session-config` with the authorized password
2. Enter the desired SPARQL endpoint URL
3. The specified endpoint will be used for your user session

This feature allows for easy testing of the migration to GraphDB without affecting other users.
